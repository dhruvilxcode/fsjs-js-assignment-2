 So does https://pixelarity.com, just to name an example.

While they do have a great API for developers, they also give you the option to simply access random images via URL’s.

Here’s an example, generating a completely random image from their massive storage:

https://source.unsplash.com/random

Specific User
We can also generate a random image from a specific user. The URL format would be like so:

https://source.unsplash.com/user/USERNAME

Click this link below to generate a random image from the user wsanter:

Specific Sizes
There’s also an option to set the size of the image you want generated. Like so:

https://source.unsplash.com/random/WIDTHxHEIGHT

Let’s generate a random image with the width and height of 300px:

https://source.unsplash.com/random/300×300

 

Random Image From Search Term
This one is really cool. You can generate images from search terms. Let’s search for city and night (so fkn creative):

https://source.unsplash.com/random/?city,night

https://source.unsplash.com/random/?city,night

You place the search terms at the end of the URL, so before you could add the size if you’d like:
